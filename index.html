	<p>So you're not an outdoorsy person. You find comfort in you average television filled day, with the AC blowing, the easy kitchen access, xbox, cell phone filled day, etc. Well now your parents are yelling at you with the whole "when I was a kid we were outside...", and looking at the average kid now a days you are probably outside with your cell phone.. with internet access. So here I have built a generator of random activities to be done when you are bored outside.</p>
	<div class="Effort">
		<h1>Requires Effort</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wire Made Bubble Wand</li>
			<li>treehouse with two levels</li>
		</ul>


	</div>

	<h3>Where this advice is applicable</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Fields</li>
		<li>Mountains</li>
		<li>Beaches</li>
		<li>Forrests</li>
	</ul>
